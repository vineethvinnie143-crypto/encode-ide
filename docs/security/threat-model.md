# eNCode threat model

Version 1, 2026-10-21, written with M0. It covers the desktop app as built from this
repository. The CLI, the router and the free-tier gateway get their own sections when they
land.

Review this document whenever a change touches a trust boundary below, and at the end of
every milestone.

## What we protect

| Asset | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| The user's machine | The agent runs commands and writes files. Code execution under the user's account is the worst outcome. |
| Source code and secrets in the workspace | They include `.env` files, credentials, private code, and git remotes with tokens. |
| Model API keys | Keys are paid credentials, and a stolen key bills the user. |
| The user's other data | That covers files outside the workspace, local services, and cloud metadata endpoints. |
| Sessions and settings | Users lose work if these are corrupted or lost. |
| Our free-tier OpenRouter key (M5) | Abuse costs money and can get the account banned. |

## Who we defend against

1. **Content the agent reads.** This is the most likely attacker. A repository, a web page,
   a dependency's README or a tool's output can carry instructions aimed at the model
   (prompt injection). The model is treated as confused, not malicious: anything it decides
   to do is checked by policy, not trusted.
2. **A hostile repository.** A folder the user opens may contain planted executables,
   `.git/config` entries that start programs, symlinks out of the workspace, or skill and
   instruction files.
3. **A hostile web page** in the browser panel, or one fetched by `web_fetch`.
4. **A network attacker** between eNCode and a model provider. Providers are reached over
   HTTPS, except the local servers the user configures.
5. **The supply chain.** That means npm packages, GitHub Actions and the Electron binary.
6. **A malicious contributor** whose pull request hides behavior in source that reads
   differently from how it runs.

Out of scope for v1:
- an attacker with administrator or root rights, or physical access;
- malware already running as the same user. This is noted where it weakens a control;
- the data practices of the model provider the user chooses (disclosure and a no-training
  mode are planned for the free tier).

## Trust boundaries

```
 untrusted content ──► model ──► agent loop ──► approval policy ──► tools ──► OS / disk / network
 (repo, web, output)    (confused deputy)       (decideApproval)      (main process)

 renderer (sandboxed) ──IPC, sender-checked──► main process ──► keychain, files, child processes
 browser panel iframe ──✕ no preload, IPC refused
```

1. **Model output to tools.** Every tool call passes `decideApproval`
   ([ADR 0004](../adr/0004-command-approval-from-one-grammar.md)). Ask and Plan modes never
   edit or run.
2. **Renderer to main.** IPC is accepted only from the main window's top frame showing the
   app's own page ([ADR 0010](../adr/0010-renderer-isolation.md)).
3. **Main to network.** Model requests go to the profile's base URL with the key bound to
   that origin ([ADR 0008](../adr/0008-api-keys-in-the-os-keychain-only.md)). `web_fetch`
   reaches public addresses only, after per-site approval
   ([ADR 0007](../adr/0007-web-fetch-asks-per-site.md)).
4. **Workspace to programs.** Programs come only from absolute `PATH` entries, never from
   the workspace ([ADR 0005](../adr/0005-programs-from-absolute-path-entries.md)).
5. **Repository to CI.** The workflow token is read-only and actions are pinned by hash
   ([ADR 0012](../adr/0012-windows-first-ci.md)).

## Threats and controls

Status: **Mitigated** in M0, **Partial** (a residual risk is listed below), or **Planned**
(with the milestone).

| # | Threat | Controls | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Prompt injection makes the agent run a harmful command | Four approval policies, and Auto review allows only proven read-only lines whose real paths stay inside and whose programs live outside the workspace (0004). Subagents inherit the policy (0006). | Partial (R1, R2) |
| T2 | Data leaves in a URL after an injection | First fetch per site asks in every mode and policy but Full access (0007) | Mitigated |
| T3 | SSRF to localhost, the LAN or cloud metadata | Public addresses only, checked at connect time against every resolved address. Same-host redirects, size and time caps (0007). | Mitigated |
| T4 | A repository's git config starts a program (fsmonitor, bare repo discovery) | `core.fsmonitor=false` and `safe.bareRepository=explicit` on every git eNCode runs (0004) | Partial (R3, R4) |
| T5 | A planted `git.exe`, `node.exe` or `.cmd` runs because of its name | Absolute `PATH` entries only, `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath`, and Auto review asks when a program resolves inside the workspace (0004, 0005) | Mitigated |
| T6 | File tools escape the workspace through `..`, symlinks, junctions or short names | Paths resolved against the root, real-path checks, deletes confined to the root and sent to the OS trash | Mitigated |
| T7 | The agent plants a git hook, fsmonitor setting or skill for later | Writes to `.git` and `.eNCode` ask under every policy but Full access, in every Windows spelling and on the real path (0004) | Mitigated |
| T8 | API keys read from disk | Sealed by the OS keychain or kept in memory only. Never `plain:`, owner-only files, leftovers removed (0008). | Partial (R5) |
| T9 | A key sent to another server by an edited base URL | Keys are bound to the server origin, and changing the origin drops the key (0008) | Mitigated |
| T10 | A key reaches the renderer, a log or a session file | The renderer learns only whether a key exists. Keys are never persisted outside the vault. | Partial (R6) |
| T11 | Model output injects script into the renderer | Hand-written markdown renderer that escapes everything and allows only a list of tags and protocols. CSP without inline script or eval (0010). | Partial (R7) |
| T12 | A page in the browser panel calls the bridge | No preload in frames, and IPC sender checks refuse child frames and foreign URLs (0010) | Mitigated |
| T13 | An environment variable points the installed app at a hostile page | `VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` is ignored when packaged (0010) | Mitigated |
| T14 | eNCode's binary is used to run arbitrary code (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, `--inspect`, `NODE_OPTIONS`) | None yet | Planned, M6 (R8) |
| T15 | A broken transcript makes providers refuse every request | Pairing invariant, repair on load, every call answered (0009) | Mitigated |
| T16 | A too-long prompt is sent repeatedly or the session dies | Compaction before each request, and a single compact-and-resend on overflow (0009) | Mitigated |
| T17 | A subagent does what its parent may not | Same mode, policy, approvals and cancellation as the parent (0006) | Mitigated |
| T18 | Source that reads differently from how it runs (bidi controls, zero-width characters) | `scripts/check-sources.mjs` in CI, and the command policy asks for lines containing them (0004, 0012) | Mitigated |
| T19 | A compromised dependency, action or Electron download | Frozen lockfile, one-day minimum release age, skipped install scripts, actions pinned by hash, read-only CI token, checksum-verified Electron download | Partial (R9) |
| T20 | Abuse of the free tier's shared key | The key never ships in the client. Gateway quotas, a `:free`-only cost firewall and a kill switch. | Planned, M5 |
| T21 | A tampered build or update | Code signing and signed updates | Planned, M6 |
| T22 | Runaway runs, rate limits and hung streams | Step cap, output caps and timeouts on commands and fetches | Partial (R10) |
| T23 | Lost or corrupted sessions | Atomic private writes | Partial (R11) |

## Residual risks

Each item names what remains, why it is acceptable for now, and who closes it.

- **R1. Full access means full access.** Under that policy nothing asks. It is an explicit
  user choice, labeled in the composer.
  - Owner: M3 adds OS sandboxing (Seatbelt, bubblewrap) to bound it on macOS and Linux.
  - Windows has no equivalent yet. Approvals are the only control there, and the plan's risk
    table says so.
- **R2. Prompt injection inside allowed actions.** Injected text can still steer which
  allowed files the agent reads and what it writes inside the workspace.
  - Untrusted web content is labeled, but labels are advisory.
  - Compaction summaries are produced from transcripts that may contain injected text, and
    the summary sits in a user message (0009). The summarizer is told the transcript is
    data, and approvals still gate every action.
  - Owner: M3 (reviewer gate, workspace trust).
- **R3. Git in a folder whose `.git/config` someone else wrote.** Under Auto review,
  "read-only" git commands such as `git diff`, `git log -p` and `git show` can still start
  programs configured in that file: `diff.external`, textconv drivers, clean filters, a
  pager. The status bar's `git status` can run clean filters too.
  - This needs a hostile `.git/config`, which a clone does not deliver but a copied or
    shared folder can.
  - Owner: M3 workspace trust. Untrusted folders get git with these keys neutralized, or no
    git at all.
- **R4. Repository discovery above the workspace.** Opening a subfolder of a repository
  makes git use the parent's `.git`. Then `git show HEAD:../other/file` can read committed
  files outside the opened folder.
  - Owner: M3. Treat `<rev>:<path>` arguments as paths, and set `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`
    when the workspace is not itself a repository root.
- **R5. Same-user malware can decrypt keys.** DPAPI and the macOS Keychain protect keys
  against other users and offline disk theft, not against code already running as the user.
  Accepted, as for every desktop app.
- **R6. Provider error messages.** Request errors include up to 600 characters of the
  provider's response, and some providers echo a masked fragment of the key. Low impact.
  - Owner: M2 router, which normalizes errors and redacts anything key-shaped.
- **R7. A renderer compromise is total.** The bridge exposes files and commands, so script
  execution in the renderer equals code execution. Defense in depth still to add:
  - runtime validation of IPC arguments;
  - a packaged-build CSP whose `connect-src` drops `https:` and localhost (the renderer
    makes no network requests itself).
  - Owner: M4, with the renderer rework.
- **R8. Electron fuses are not set.** `RunAsNode`, `EnableNodeOptionsEnvironmentVariable`,
  `EnableNodeCliInspectArguments`, `OnlyLoadAppFromAsar` and embedded asar integrity
  validation must be flipped when packaging is reworked.
  - Owner: M6.
- **R9. Build tools run with full access.** Vite, esbuild and TypeScript execute during
  install and build on developer machines and in CI. They are pinned through the lockfile and
  the minimum release age, but not sandboxed. electron-builder downloads its own tooling
  when packaging (not run in CI yet).
  - Owner: M6, with reproducible packaging.
- **R10. Provider resilience.** There is no backoff on 429 and 5xx, no first-token or idle
  watchdog on streams, and no failover.
  - Owner: M2 router (breakers, cooldowns, watchdogs, mid-stream failover).
- **R11. Session persistence.** Sessions are written synchronously on the main thread, so
  large sessions block the UI. A capture cut short by Stop is persisted only with a later
  event, and nothing is flushed on quit.
  - Owner: M1 JSONL sessions (append-only, flushed per event).

## Verification

- Unit tests cover the command policy, the egress table, program resolution, the key vault,
  private files, compaction and the provider. They include property tests with fixed seeds,
  and each security fix was mutation-checked.
- The end-to-end smoke runs on every pull request on Windows. It checks:
  - the approval cards;
  - a key stored through the real `safeStorage` reaching the provider, and never the
    renderer;
  - Plan-mode subagents unable to write;
  - the web_fetch approval and private-address refusal;
  - compaction after an overflow refusal.
